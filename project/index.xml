      <description>Taking the latest and greatest advances in natural language processing and deep learning, CPSSD students trained a series of models to classify human deception in datasets of user submitted reviews. The output of the research was threefold: a scientific paper describing our research; an open source API providing access to query our trained models; and Lucify, a web interface allowing end users to view an interactive and comprehensive report of review deception and legitimacy.</description>

      <description>Dipla is a distributed computing framework for Python built by Cian Ruane, Noah Donnelly, Brandon Ibbotson and Stefan Kennedy.
Goals Our original goal and the main guiding principle behind Dipla was to build a framework that was easy to reason about from the outside but still quite clever on the inside. Our hope was that we could create something that allowed people to write distributed Python code that looked almost the same as if it were running locally.</description>

      <description>Feedlark is an RSS aggregator built by Aaron Delaney, Lucas Savva, Cian Ruane, Ross O&amp;rsquo;sullivan and Noah Donnelly.
Feedlark aims to be efficient, fast, and smart. Users can get updates on RSS or Atom feeds they follow through a slick Material Design interface. They can receive email summaries of their stream, view their stream through a plaintext endpoint (ideal for command line usage!) and bookmark articles for later.
What&amp;rsquo;s more, a user can upvote and downvote articles according to their interests.</description>

      <description>Krayate is a simple game engine that uses raycast rendering.
It seeks to evoke the feeling of early 3d rendered games such as DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D. Krayate features a custom programming language, and allows users to design interactable objects.</description>
