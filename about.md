## About CPSSD

[Computational Problem Solving and Software Development](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/undergraduate/pssd/computational-problem-solving-software-development-cpssd) (CPSSD) is an undergraduate computing course in [Dublin City University](http://dcu.ie) that requires applicants to have a prior knowledge of programming. This means that students can save time re-learning the basics, and jump straight into making some cool things.

The course has a special admission procedure. Applicants do not need to worry about points, but must submit a portfolio, pass an interview, achieve the minimum DCU entry requirements, and pass honours maths. This is outlined in detail [here](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/undergraduate/pssd/portfolio-interview).

## About This Site
The [official CPSSD site](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/undergraduate/pssd/computational-problem-solving-software-development-cpssd) should be the primary reference for anyone interested in the course. However, this page exists to provide people with a friendlier introduction to CPSSD, showcase some of the projects CPSSD students have created, and bring together the internet presence of those students.
